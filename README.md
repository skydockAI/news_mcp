OpenAI's presence in the enterprise AI market is significantly growing, with over 32% of U.S. businesses now subscribing to its products, as reported by Ramp's AI Index. The rapid adoption is seen with a leap from 18.9% in January to 32.4% in April 2025, while competitors like Anthropic and Google AI have struggled to maintain similar traction. OpenAI expects its enterprise revenue, projected at $12.7 billion for the year, to contribute to long-term growth despite not anticipating profitability until 2029. In other news, the U.S. Treasury Department is reviewing Benchmark's $75 million investment in Chinese AI startup Manus amid concerns about compliance with newer restrictions on Chinese investments. Manus claims compliance by structuring operations in the Cayman Islands and focusing on a "wrapper" around existing AI models rather than developing its own.
